3.7.2.6
-------

Fixed some MTG Arena import / export issues

- ``DOM`` set code is exported as ``DAR``
- trailing letter in ``Number`` of Split / Double-faced card is truncated, e.g. ``3a`` -> ``3``

I was not able to do thorough testing, because a successfull import into MTGA requires having all 
the cards in your collection so there might still be undiscovered import / export issues left.
