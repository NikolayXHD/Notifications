3.2.1.2
-------

``Drag-n-dropping`` the card between deck zones now removes the card from the zone it was dragged 
from. The change does not apply when ``drag-n-dropping`` between different windows or to ``sample 
hand`` zone.

Fixed a bug allowing to reorder the deck cards using ``drag-n-drop`` while the dragged card was 
removed e.g. by pressing ``Ctrl`` + ``Z``. The deck was becoming corrupted, preventing it from 
saving to a file or copying to clipboard.
