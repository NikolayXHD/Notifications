Clipboard operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tuned copy and paste operations to allow moving cards between deck zones using them.

- In ``main deck`` zone copy and paste operations affect ``main deck`` and ``sideboard``
- In ``sideboard`` zone copy and paste operations affect ``sideboard`` only
- In ``sample hand`` zone copy and paste operations affect ``sample hand`` only

The same scope applies to ``clear`` button in window title.

Drag-n-drop files and text over tabs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Deck zone switches when dragging a file or text over it. Previously this only worked when dragging
a card from Mtgdb.Gui. 
- The same works with tab headers in window title.

Fixed crash when dropping deck file or text before cards are loaded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now loading the decks is delayed until the loading process completes.

Fixed requiring deck name 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

when loading a deck in XMage format.
