2.2.6
-----

Compatibility with MTGO (Magic The Gathering Online)
You can save and load decks and collection in plain-text format created by MTGO.
For details see Mtgdb.Gui help or [online wiki](https://github.com/NikolayXHD/Mtgdb/wiki/02.-Import-collection-&-decks-from-Magic-The-Gathering-Online).

As you can now import collection from file, as well as save it, you can in fact switch between 
several collections e.g. your physical collection and MTGO collection. You can also easily 
manipulate your collection outside Mtgd.Gui because `*.txt` collection format is very simple.

Filter button uncheck behaviour was slighlty changed filter to avoid accidentally creating a filter 
that excludes all cards by prohibiting all values of a certain property. Previosly I abandoned this 
approach as it did not work well with filtering by Mana Cost. Now I think I got the right way to do 
it.
