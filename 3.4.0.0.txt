Search similar cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Search text supports syntax for looking for cards similar to a given card.
Example query: ``like: rancor``. When looking for similar cards only ``Text`` 
and ``Generated mana`` fields are considered. Search result is ordered to
show more similar cards first unless there is another sorting by some field.

There is a new button on top-right corner of card image to add similar cards query
to search input.

Correctly higlighting matched phrases in Search result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a query like ``text: "your hand"`` the entire phrase is highligted.
Previously words ``your`` and ``hand`` would be highlighted separately.

Remove term from search input when clicking search button over card text second time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously second and subsequent clicks on search button would be adding the same term
to search input.

Showing entire card name in intellisense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously intellisense on card name was showing only separate words from name.

Fixed intellisense bug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to this bug many relevant values would not be shown in intellisense, e.g. on query
``name: thalia`` there would be no ``thalia's lieutenant`` suggested.
