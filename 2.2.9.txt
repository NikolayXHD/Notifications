Pasting deck from Clipboard text

Added `Paste` menu to window header and corresponding keyboard shortcuts
* `Ctrl`+`V` to create a new deck from Clipboard text
* `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`V` to add cards to an existing deck instead of creating new one

Drag-n-dropping deck text from websites and other applications.

Works the same way as pasting.
* Normal `drag-n-drop` to create new deck from dragged text
* `Shift`+`drag-n-drop` to add cards from dragged text to an existing deck
