Selectable text in Search result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to copy some text into Clipboard, it's no longer necessary to select the text
from tooltips. Just select the text you want directly in search result.

If you want to select some text that does not fit into field area use ``Ctrl`` + ``A`` to 
select all text in a hovered field.

When selecting text in small fields hold ``Alt`` to suppress showing ``Sort`` and ``Search`` 
buttons over text.

Press ``Esc`` or ``click`` on non-text area within search result to remove text selection. Useful if
you want to ``Ctrl`` + ``C`` your deck into cliboard instead of currently selected text.

Suppressing tooltips when ``Alt`` key is down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using ``Alt`` key to ease selecting text in small fields, it's also nice to get rid of tooltips.
