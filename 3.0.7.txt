3.0.7
-----

Added ``{C}`` to ``GeneratedMana`` for cards that create mana by copying it

Added any color (``{any}``) button to filter by ``GeneratedMana``

All mana symbols in ``GeneratedMana`` field are stored as separate words. Enables queries like 
``generatedmana: \{any\}``. Otherwise you would have to type ``generatedmana: *\{any\}*`` which is
too unusable.
