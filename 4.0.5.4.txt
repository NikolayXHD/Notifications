-------
Fix searching by complex phrase query with boolean clauses of different length. Consider query:
```
text: "under (your OR its owner's) control"
```
Notice that ``your`` and ``its owner's`` are word sequences of different length, 1 and 2 (actually 4) correspondingly.
Previously, in such cases the query would not match correctly.
