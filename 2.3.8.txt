2.3.8
-----

Added some missing card prices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

for ~700 cards including all aftermath cards. These cards have no ``mciNumber`` in data from 
mtgjson.com, but they do have actual pages in http://magiccards.info with urls derived from 
``number`` field.

Search input
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed wrong caret (user input) location on first click

Fixed ``Esc`` not hiding intellisense

Special meaning of wildcards ``?`` and ``*`` in range query even when it's not numeric but textual 

    releasedate: [2017\-01\-01 TO *]

is interpreted as ``ReleaseDate >= 2017-01-01`` rather than ``2017-01-01 <= ReleaseDate <= *``, 
with * meaning literally star character.

Redrawn zoom icon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to make it more distinguishable over card pictures.
