4.0.3.1
-------
- Insert the card dragged into deck at the position of mouse cursor instead of adding it to the end of deck
- Prevent accidental deck zone switching while adding / removing card from deck by drag-n-drop

Problem
~~~~~~~
Card can be added / removed from deck by dragging it from search result to deck panel or vice versa.

You can also drag-n-drop the cards between different deck zones by pointing mouse cursor to the tab
header of target deck zone.

Drag-n-drop between deck zones gets in the way of adding / removing with drag-n-drop because deck zone tab 
headers are between deck and search result. When dragging the card to deck or away from deck the mouse often
touches the tab header of another deck zone and thus produces unwanted deck zone switching.

Solution
~~~~~~~~
- When dragging from search result to deck, deck zone is never changed
- When dropping card from deck to search result (to remove the card) the deck zone from which the card
  was removed is selected again if you changed the zone while dragging.
