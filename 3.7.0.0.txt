3.7.0.0
-------

New ``Deck list`` tab in deck panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It lets you save the decks within application. You can make searches against 
deck list.

Filter by cards present in your Deck has splitted into two modes:

* Show cards from currently edited deck
* Show cards from any saved deck matching search criteria for decks

Search by tags on cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All above lets you use decks as effective *tags* on cards. For instance, you can 
create a deck called ``Wishlist``, then another one called ``For sale``. Then by 
combining

- Search against decks
- Filtering cards by presense in flitered saved decks

you are effectively filtering cards by presence of *Wishlist* or *For sale* tags on them.

Current limitations of ``Deck list`` feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Only 2 ``Deck`` fields are available to search against - ``Name`` and ``Mana``.
- There is no way to mass-import decks into Deck List tab. Decks must be opened from a 
  file and saved into deck list one by one.

These limitations are to be addressed in future releases of Mtgdb.Gui.
