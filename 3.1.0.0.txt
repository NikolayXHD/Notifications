Improved alignment in Search result and Deck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When space is missing, making some card images truncated, the cards are aligned relative to a 
corner, by default the top-left corner. The card in this corner is allways fully visible. To fully 
display a truncated card use alignment button in the nearby corner.

When there is excessive horizontal or vertical space to display the cards, they are aligned by 
center.
