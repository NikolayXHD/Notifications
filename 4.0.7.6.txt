4.0.7.6
-------

Added possibility to add massive amounts of cards to collection with few clicks using Mtgdb.Gui 
filters and clipboard. This can be helpful if you purchased all (or most) cards from  a set.

1. Filter to the set using Search bar query like ``SetCode: ISD``.

2. Narrow down the search result to the cards you want to add N copies each.

   Get the card names that need to be excluded to the Search bar by clicking on Search button over 
   card name. The query becomes ``SetCode: ISD NameEn: "some name"``.
  
   You will need this  either because you need these cards or because the number of copies for this 
   card is not the same as the ones you adding now.

   Edit the query to exclude the card, add `AND NOT` operator, so the query becomes 
   ``SetCode: ISD AND NOT NameEn: "card name"``.

3. ``Copy search result to clipboard`` (``Ctrl`` + ``Alt`` + ``C``) - 1 copy of each card in search result is 
   added to clipboard.
4. ``Add to collection from Clipboard`` (``Alt`` + ``V``) N times where N is the number of copies of each 
   card you want to add.
5. Repeat steps 2. - 4. for all values of N.
