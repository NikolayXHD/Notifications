Fixed a crash preventing automatic update
-----------------------------------------

Problem
~~~~~~~

There was a bug preventing all new users who downloaded Mtgdb.Gui.v2.0 or later from doing 
auto-upgrading to newer versions using ``Update`` window.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

In order to have the bug fixed Mtgdb.Gui users need to download and manually install 
Mtgdg.Gui.v3.0.8.0 or later from http://goo.gl/LuC6ce
