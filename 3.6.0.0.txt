-------

Complex phrase query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subqueries can now be used inside phrase query: ``text: "/counters?/ (on OR from) it"``

- First word is specified by a regular expression subquery ``/counters?/``.
- Second word is specified by a boolean subquery ``on OR from``.
- Third word ``it`` is specified simply as in a regular phrase query.

Use modifier to allow non-zero words count between the words in phrase query: ``text: "counter target spell"~3``.

Use fractional modifier (new feature) to allow reverse order of words: ``text: "dealt damage"~2.5``
